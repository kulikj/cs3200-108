# SchedulePlanner Project

This repo contains the different sources that are used in conjunction with AppSmith to create our SchedulePlanner application, to be used by both advisors and students at Northeastern University.

## Database
The db folder contains a bootstrap sql file named db_bootstrap.sql which contains the sql for all the tables including mock values.

## Flask App
The flask-app folder contains routes for two different personas - advisors and students, as well as for classes. Here, routes contain both get and post requests.

## Ngrok and AppSmith
Ngrok was utilied to host necessary local data and connect our REST Api in AppSmith
